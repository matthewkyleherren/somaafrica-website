</b></p><p class="p book"><b>12.2 Arbitration Rules and Forum.</b>&nbsp;The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Clyde, 579 Broadway, 2C, New York, New York 10012, Attn: Support. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims with an amount in controversy under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’ most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/<!-- --> </a>; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/<!-- --> </a>.

If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and you cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Clyde will pay them for you.&nbsp;

You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the U.S., county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
